# Run by the harness as a SessionStart hook, not by the agent — see the
# the-harness-announces-waytides-installation-and-the-agent-never-prints-the-notice rule. It reads the package directories
# actually present and emits the notice as JSON on stdout, which the harness
# renders as its own message.
#
# The notice never disrupts a session: any problem exits quietly with no output.
#
# Invocation:
#
#   slasher/system/foundation/session-start.sh
#   slasher/system/foundation/session-start.sh instruction
#
# Nobody types the first. The second prints the read instruction alone, as plain text, and is
# run by the /load skill, so /load follows the same text load rules acts on rather than a copy.
# install.sh wires the first into .claude/settings.json as the SessionStart hook command,
# and the harness runs it. The line is recorded because a script whose
# invocation is not written down is one nobody can reproduce when the wiring breaks.

# Never let a notice break a session start.

# It states the read is unconditional because the failure it answers was conditional —
# a session opened with a small request, the read was judged not to be worth it, and the
# session then grew into rule edits and package publishes governed by rules never read.
#
# This does not verify that the rules were read. Nothing here can: the hook runs before

# of the instruction being buried in a file the agent may not open, and no more.

# binding rule (the a-projects-binding-rules-are-recorded-in-its-packages-and-its-local-rules-directory rule) and the AGENTS.md bootstrap both name it without a
# condition, and an instruction narrower than the rule it exists to get followed is the defect
# being corrected. A project with no local rules yet is the ordinary case, not an error, and a

Before your first substantive action in this session, run %s/foundation/load-rules.sh from the project root, in one command, and read its whole output; where the output is saved to a file because it is long, read that file to its end. It prints, each under a line naming it, every package'\''s rules-pre-loaded.md and vocabulary.md, foundation first, since it defines the system; the vocabularies'\'' terms are binding and cannot be applied unread. It then prints the local rules this project adds, in %s/rules/, which are binding in the same way, this project'\''s own vocabulary, %s/vocabulary.md, whose terms and substitutions decide over every package'\''s, and the journal. Follow the rules. Read no rule file one by one; the loader'\''s output is the read. Each package'\''s ON DEMAND section lists rules it does not print, each with its trigger and the command that loads it. When the act a trigger names comes up, run that command and follow the rule it prints before acting. Read only those two beside the packages, unless an installed package'\''s own rule directs another read: the working directories next to them — logs, items, implementations, migration — are worked with as their own conventions describe and are not read as binding rules at session start. The read is unconditional: the apparent size of the first request is not a reason to defer it, because the size of the opening request predicts nothing about where the session goes. Do not print the startup display the the-startup-display-prints-as-the-session-starts rule describes. The harness prints it. Once the rules are read, wait for the engineer to make a request. The engineer may open with /load, or with the command load rules, which ask for exactly that and nothing more.
