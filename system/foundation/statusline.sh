# Run by the harness as its statusLine command — see the
# announce-waytide-at-session-start rule. Where the SessionStart notice marks
# the moment the system loaded, this keeps the fact on screen for the whole
# session, outside the conversation.
#
# Because a project-level statusLine replaces whatever status line the developer
# configured for themselves, this renders the working directory and git branch
# too, so adopting it takes nothing away.
