The engineer typed `/work-status $ARGUMENTS`.

1. Where the first word is `help`, print the text of `help.md`, in this skill's directory, and do nothing more.
2. Otherwise, load the rule that governs the act. From the project root, run `waytide/system/foundation/load-rules.sh work-status-says-what-was-recently-done-and-what-is-next`. Where the project has no `waytide/` directory, run `system/foundation/load-rules.sh` with the same rule name. Follow the rule it prints.
