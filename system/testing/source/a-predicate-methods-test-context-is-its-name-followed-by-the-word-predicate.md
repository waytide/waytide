# A predicate method's test context is its name followed by the word "Predicate"

**Trigger:** When naming a test context for a ?-suffixed predicate method

The `context` for a predicate method — a `?`-suffixed, boolean-returning method — is named by the method's name (without the `?`) followed by **"Predicate"**. So `defined?` → `context "Defined Predicate"`, not `context "Defined?"`.

Examples: `defined?` → "Defined Predicate", `valid?` → "Valid Predicate", and `empty?` → "Empty Predicate".

**Why:** The context names the *feature* under test. "Defined?" carries the method's punctuation and reads as a bare question. "Defined Predicate" names what the method **is**, a predicate on definedness. That is the literal, precise description, "predicate" being the exact term for a boolean-returning method. It also keeps the `?` out of a `context` label, where it would read as interrogative prose rather than a feature name. Consistent with the name-concepts-literally-not-by-analogy-code-or-jargon rule and the test-context-nesting conventions.

**How to apply:** When the unit under test is a predicate method `foo?`, name its feature `context` "Foo Predicate". Titlecase the name without the `?`, then append "Predicate".

1. A predicate method is a `?`-suffixed, boolean-returning method.
2. Name a predicate method's test `context` by the method's name without the `?`, followed by "Predicate".
3. Titlecase the method's name before appending "Predicate".
4. `defined?` → `context "Defined Predicate"`, not `context "Defined?"`.
5. Examples: `defined?` → "Defined Predicate", `valid?` → "Valid Predicate", and `empty?` → "Empty Predicate".
6. Keep the `?` out of a `context` label.
