# A precondition documents the factors that decide a test's outcome, and its predicate reads inline

A **precondition** is an `assert` or `refute` that is **not** a test. It sits in a context beside the controls and the actuation rather than inside a `test` block.

**Its purpose is to clarify the deciding factors.** A test's outcome is determined by conditions and factors that are frequently **not clearly expressed in the test script** — most often the **controls**. A control is named for itself, not for the properties of the value it produces. `Controls::Account::Sequence.example` says nothing about which positions that account has already processed.

The definition that would say so lives in another file. The factor that actually decides the outcome is therefore absent from the script the reader is reading. **A precondition puts it there.**

```ruby
handler = Handlers::Commands::Transactions.new

deposit = Controls::Commands::Deposit.example

account = Controls::Account::Sequence.example

assert(account.processed?(deposit.metadata.global_position))

handler.store.add(account.id, account)

handler.(deposit)

test "Deposited Event is not Written" do
  assert(deposited.nil?)
end
```

No event is written **because** the account has already processed that global position. Nothing in `Controls::Account::Sequence.example` shows that, so without the precondition the reader has the outcome and no account of what produced it. The precondition states the deciding factor where it is needed.

**It documents by asserting, and that is why it is an assertion rather than a comment.** Prose narration could state the same factor, and would never be checked. It can drift from the control it describes and go on reading as true long after it stopped being so. An assertion states the factor **and** verifies it, so this documentation cannot become false without the suite saying so. Documentation that is checked is the whole reason a deciding factor is written as an assertion.

**It qualifies the test rather than preventing a regression.** A test observes an outcome of the unit under test and prevents its regression. A precondition observes nothing about that unit — it states what must already be true for the test's observation to mean anything. That decides how a failure reads: **when a precondition fails, the test's result is meaningless, not wrong.** The unit may be perfectly correct. The test simply did not exercise what it claims to.

**Where one is warranted:** ask what determines this outcome, and whether the script shows it. Where a deciding factor is legible on the page, a precondition adds nothing. Where it sits inside a control, in a prior state, or in a derivation the reader cannot see, surfacing it is the precondition's job.

A consequence follows from the same gap, and it is worth naming because it is the sharpest form of the problem. **Where a deciding factor is invisible, a test can pass without exercising what it names.** A value is already present before the actuation set it. A connection is already open. A search finds nothing, so the assertion is made against nothing and passes vacuously.

Documenting the factor closes that too. But the criterion is the legibility of the deciding factors, not only the risk of a vacuous pass.

```ruby
context "Database Connection" do
  session = MessageStore::Postgres::Session.build

  refute(session.connected?)

  test "Connects on first use" do
    refute_raises do
      session.execute('SELECT 1;')
    end
  end
end
```

**The predicate reads inline — no explaining variable.** The assertion's own expression carries the condition, read as a sentence at the point it is written: `refute(session.connected?)` is *the session is not connected*. `assert(account.processed?(deposit.metadata.global_position))` is *the account has processed that position*.

**This is a deliberate exception to the a-test-block-holds-only-the-assertion-and-its-values-are-declared-in-the-enclosing-context rule**, which requires every operand inside a `test` block to be bound to an explaining variable first. Neither of that rule's reasons reaches a precondition: it has one operand, so nothing is buried in a nested expression to be parsed inside-out. A name bound for it would only restate the predicate — `connected = session.connected?` in front of `refute(connected)` adds a line and no information. **A precondition carries no name because its expression is the name.**

**A block is an expression.** Where the deciding factor is that an actuation completes, `assert_raises` and `refute_raises` take a block, and that block is the precondition's expression. The discipline is unchanged: nothing is bound, nothing is named, and the actuation is written in place rather than behind a variable.

**It sits immediately before what it qualifies.** Before the **actuation** when it documents a factor in the controls or in a prior state. Before the **test** when it documents a factor in a value derived from the result. The two are the same construct in the same relation — the precondition stands directly ahead of the thing whose meaning depends on it.

```ruby
deposit_message = write.one_message do |written|
  written.instance_of?(Messages::Commands::Deposit)
end

refute(deposit_message.nil?)

test "Deposit message follows previous message" do
  assert(deposit_message.follows?(previous_message))
end
```

**It is not coverage, and it prevents nothing.** A precondition asserts over the controls, a prior state, a derivation, or **the actuation's completion where the controls are what decide it**. It never asserts over the unit's behavior as an outcome. So it is outside what the do-not-test-the-platform rule weighs and outside what a coverage test is for. Nothing about the unit is established by one passing.

**The line is what the assertion is for, not what it is written over.** `refute_raises` around an actuation is a **precondition** in one case. The controls are set so the actuation would ordinarily fail, something in that setup averts it, and the script does not show as much. It is a **test** when whether the unit raises is the thing being established. The same expression serves the two of them, and only its purpose separates them.

```ruby
control_destination = Controls::Constant.example(
  name: "Destination",
  inner_constants: [control_excluded_constant_name]
)

refute_raises do
  Constant::Import.(control_source, control_destination, except: control_excluded_constant_name)
end
```

The destination owns the excluded name, so without `except:` the import is refused. Nothing else in the script says so, and every outcome below depends on it.

**Why:** a test script is read to learn what its outcome depends on. The controls convention deliberately puts the construction of example values behind a name. So the factors that decide the outcome are frequently the ones least visible at the test. A test whose deciding factors are invisible cannot be read. The reader sees an outcome asserted and no account of what produced it. In its worst form it passes without exercising what it names, and reports prevention that is not there.

Writing the factor as an assertion rather than a comment is what makes the clarification trustworthy. A comment claims, and an assertion is checked. So the documentation and the fact cannot drift apart in silence.

Keeping it a bare assertion rather than a named test is what keeps the two legible as different things. A named test claims the unit behaves a certain way. A precondition claims only that the ground the test stands on is the ground it appears to.

**How to apply:** when writing or reading a test, ask what determines its outcome. Ask whether the script shows it. Look first at the controls, whose values are named rather than described.

Where a deciding factor is not expressed, write a bare `assert` or `refute` stating it. Where the factor is that an actuation completes, write a bare `assert_raises` or `refute_raises` instead. Read its predicate inline, with no explaining variable.

Place it immediately before what it qualifies. That is the actuation for a factor in the controls or a prior state. It is the test for a factor in a derived value.

Do not wrap it in a `test` block, do not name it, and do not bind its operand. Do not write it as a `comment` instead. An unchecked statement of a deciding factor is the thing this replaces.

An actuation's completion may be the thing being established, rather than the ground a later observation stands on. That is a test. It belongs in a `test` block.

## Compressed

1. A precondition is an `assert` or `refute` that is not a test.
2. It sits in a context beside the controls and the actuation, not inside a `test` block.
3. Its purpose is to state the factors that decide a test's outcome when the test script does not clearly express them.
4. Those factors are most often in the controls. A control is named for itself, not for the properties of the value it produces.
5. `Controls::Account::Sequence.example` says nothing about which positions that account has already processed. The definition that would say so is in another file.

```ruby
handler = Handlers::Commands::Transactions.new

deposit = Controls::Commands::Deposit.example

account = Controls::Account::Sequence.example

assert(account.processed?(deposit.metadata.global_position))

handler.store.add(account.id, account)

handler.(deposit)

test "Deposited Event is not Written" do
  assert(deposited.nil?)
end
```

6. Here no event is written because the account has already processed that global position. The precondition states that factor where it is needed.
7. Write the deciding factor as an assertion, not as a comment. An assertion states the factor and also verifies it, so it cannot silently become false.
8. A precondition qualifies the test. It does not prevent a regression, and it observes nothing about the unit under test.
9. When a precondition fails, the test's result is meaningless, not wrong. The unit may be correct, but the test did not exercise what it claims to.
10. To decide whether one is warranted, ask what determines the outcome and whether the script shows it.
11. Where a deciding factor is legible on the page, do not add a precondition.
12. Where the factor sits inside a control, in a prior state, or in a derivation the reader cannot see, write a precondition that surfaces it.
13. Where a deciding factor is invisible, a test can pass without exercising what it names. Examples: a value already present, a connection already open, a search that finds nothing.
14. The criterion is whether the deciding factors are legible, not only the risk of a vacuous pass.

```ruby
context "Database Connection" do
  session = MessageStore::Postgres::Session.build

  refute(session.connected?)

  test "Connects on first use" do
    refute_raises do
      session.execute('SELECT 1;')
    end
  end
end
```

15. Write the predicate inline, with no explaining variable. The assertion's own expression carries the condition and reads as a sentence.
16. `refute(session.connected?)` reads as *the session is not connected*. `assert(account.processed?(deposit.metadata.global_position))` reads as *the account has processed that position*.
17. This is a deliberate exception to the a-test-block-holds-only-the-assertion-and-its-values-are-declared-in-the-enclosing-context rule, which requires every operand inside a `test` block to be bound to an explaining variable.
18. That rule does not apply because a precondition has one operand, and a bound name would only restate the predicate.
19. Do not write `connected = session.connected?` in front of `refute(connected)`. A precondition carries no name, because its expression is the name.
20. Where the deciding factor is that an actuation completes, use `assert_raises` or `refute_raises` with a block. The block is the precondition's expression.
21. In that block, bind nothing and name nothing. Write the actuation in place, not behind a variable.
22. Place the precondition immediately before what it qualifies.
23. Place it before the actuation when it documents a factor in the controls or in a prior state.
24. Place it before the test when it documents a factor in a value derived from the result.

```ruby
deposit_message = write.one_message do |written|
  written.instance_of?(Messages::Commands::Deposit)
end

refute(deposit_message.nil?)

test "Deposit message follows previous message" do
  assert(deposit_message.follows?(previous_message))
end
```

25. A precondition may assert over the controls, a prior state, a derivation, or the actuation's completion where the controls decide it.
26. It never asserts over the unit's behavior as an outcome. It is not coverage, and a passing one establishes nothing about the unit.
27. It falls outside what the do-not-test-the-platform rule weighs and outside what a coverage test is for.
28. Whether an assertion is a precondition or a test depends on its purpose, not on what it is written over.
29. `refute_raises` around an actuation is a precondition when the controls would ordinarily make the actuation fail, the setup averts that, and the script does not show it.
30. It is a test when whether the unit raises is the thing being established. Put that in a `test` block.

```ruby
control_destination = Controls::Constant.example(
  name: "Destination",
  inner_constants: [control_excluded_constant_name]
)

refute_raises do
  Constant::Import.(control_source, control_destination, except: control_excluded_constant_name)
end
```

31. Here the destination owns the excluded name, so without `except:` the import is refused. Nothing else in the script says so.
32. When writing or reading a test, look at the controls first, because their values are named rather than described.
33. Do not wrap a precondition in a `test` block. Do not name it, and do not bind its operand.
34. Do not write a deciding factor as a `comment` in place of a precondition.
35. **Why:** The controls convention hides how example values are built, so the factors that decide an outcome are often the least visible ones. A test with invisible deciding factors cannot be read, and it can pass without exercising what it names. An assertion is checked where a comment is not. Keeping a precondition a bare assertion, not a named test, keeps it distinct from a claim about how the unit behaves.
