# Waytide's prose conforms to the STE writing rules

ASD-STE100 holds 53 writing rules in nine sections. They bind Waytide's prose, its rules, its
records, its commit messages, and the agent's answers. This rule holds the ones Waytide breaks
most, and it grows as more are found in use.

**This rule is part of Simplified Technical English Vector, or STEve** — Waytide's implementation
of the standard. See the waytide-keeps-its-word-where-the-ste-word-means-something-else rule beside
it, which states what STEve is and the order its two parts decide in.

**A phrase passes two checks, in this order.** Waytide's own vocabulary decides first. The
standard decides second. In the two phrases worked below below, Waytide's vocabulary caught the word before
the standard did.

## The writing rules

| The rule | What it requires |
|---|---|
| STE Rule 1.3 | Use an approved word only with its approved meaning |
| STE Rule 3.6 | Use the active voice. In descriptive writing the passive is permitted only where the agent is unknown |
| STE Rule 4.2 | Do not omit words. Its own words: *Each sentence must have all its parts* |
| STE Rule 8.1 | Do not use the semicolon. The standard's reason is that a semicolon lets you write very long sentences |
| STE Rules 5.1 and 6.3 | A procedural sentence takes 20 words. A descriptive sentence takes 25 |
| STE Rule 6.6 | A descriptive paragraph takes six sentences |

## Two worked phrases

**The agent wrote each of these, and each broke Waytide's vocabulary first.**

### `swept across 20 files`

- **`swept`** — the `language` vocabulary discontinues `sweep` for `conform`. The STE dictionary
  replaces `sweep (v)` with `SCAN`, which does not carry the meaning either.
- **`across`** — `ACROSS (prep)` is approved only as *from one side to the other*. STE Rule 1.3
  restricts a word to its approved meanings. Write `in`.
- **`was swept`** — the passive with a known agent, against STE Rule 3.6.
- **the semicolon** in the sentence that held it, against STE Rule 8.1.

Before: `` `gate` is a technical noun; its verb form is `wait`, swept across 20 files. ``

After: `` `gate` is a technical noun. Its verb form is `wait`. Twenty files conform to this. ``

### `The two checks green`

- **`green`** — the `testing` vocabulary substitutes `verified`. The word is also absent from the
  dictionary.
- **`The two`** — `the two (adj)` is not approved. The STE dictionary gives `THE TWO (TN)`, as in
  `ATTACH THE TWO ENDS`.
- **No verb** — against STE Rule 4.2.

Before: `The two checks green`

After: `The two checks are verified.` Or, to say what happened rather than name a state:
`The two checks found no defect.`

**`checks` survives.** `CHECK (n)` is approved, as in `DO A CHECK OF THE …`. Only `check (v)` is
not approved, and the STE dictionary gives `MAKE SURE` for it.

**Why:** the writing rules are where the standard reaches every sentence, and the STE dictionary is
where it reaches a word at a time. A writer who reads only the STE dictionary keeps writing long
passive sentences out of approved words. Each rule is recorded here as it is met in use, beside
the phrase that met it. That makes a rule findable by the shape of the mistake, not by its
number.

**How to apply:** check a phrase against Waytide's vocabulary first, then against the STE dictionary,
then against the rules above. Write the active voice. Write all the words. Use no semicolon. Keep
a descriptive sentence to 25 words and a procedural sentence to 20. When a new rule is met in use,
add it to the table and add the phrase that met it. Related: the
waytide-keeps-its-word-where-the-ste-word-means-something-else rule in this directory, the `language` and
`testing` vocabularies, and the specification at `waytide/local/reference/`.
