# Where an entry carries no time, ask for one through the selection interface

**Trigger:** When creating a journal entry for which the writer gave no time

When creating a journal entry, where the writer has not given a **time**, ask them through the selection interface. Do not choose a default, and do not invent or guess a placeholder time.

**A date settles nothing about the time.** *Yesterday*, *today*, *last Tuesday*, and an explicit date each fix the day and say nothing about the hour. So the ask fires for each of them, and the answer decides only whether the entry carries a time and what it is.

**The ask carries these options:**

1. **No time.** The filename drops the `T HH-MM` block and becomes `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md`. The datetime line drops the `at HH:MM` with it and reads `Ddd Mon D YYYY`.
2. **Now**, with the current time in the label — `Now (2:01 PM)`. The filename takes the `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM` prefix and the datetime line reads `Ddd Mon D YYYY at HH:MM`.
3. **Enter the time.** The writer gives the value. A value stated to the second takes the `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS` prefix. Every other value stops at the minute.
4. **Explain**, per the foundation package's present-every-prompt-to-the-engineer-through-the-selection-ui rule.

**`Now` is held to the minute, like every other answer.** It reads a clock that has a seconds value, and the stamp drops it. Seconds reach a filename only where the writer states them, so no answer here produces a resolution the writer did not give. See the journal-entries-are-recorded-in-the-writers-journal-directory-one-file-per-entry rule.

**`Now` is offered only for an entry about today.** For a back-dated entry the current clock time is not the entry's time, and naming it `Now` would say it is. The ask then carries **No time**, **Enter the time**, and **Explain**.

**`Enter the time` is not a free-text option, and adding it does not break the present-every-prompt-to-the-engineer-through-the-selection-ui rule.** That rule forbids an agent-supplied free-text option because the harness already gives one for what the options do not contain. This question asks for a time, so a specific time is an answer **within** the question rather than outside it. The harness's free-text option remains for anything else.

**A date-only entry sorts to the start of its day**, which matches the filename sort, where `-` precedes `T`.

**The date is settled before the ask, and the ask does not revisit it.** Where the writer referred to a day, the entry takes that day. Where they referred to none, it takes today. The journal-entries-are-recorded-in-the-writers-journal-directory-one-file-per-entry rule's dating default governs that, and this rule governs the time alone.

**Why:** the writer owns the timestamp, and a guessed time is a fabricated fact. Asking keeps the journal accurate.

The trigger is the **time** rather than the whole datetime because a day-granular phrase is the ordinary way a person refers to when something happened. *Yesterday* is a complete answer about the day and no answer at all about the hour. A rule that fired only where the writer said nothing would take *yesterday* as settling the two, and would then have to invent an hour or drop one without asking.

Offering the date-only form as an answer is what makes it reachable. It was formerly a separate signal the writer had to know to give, which is a capability nobody discovers.

**How to apply:** on a new entry, check whether the writer gave a time. Where they did not, ask through the selection interface. Offer **No time**, **Now** with the current time in its label, **Enter the time**, and **Explain**. Drop **Now** where the entry is not about today.

Stamp the filename to the minute under **Now**, and under a time the writer stated to the minute. Write seconds only where the writer stated seconds.

Name the file and write the datetime line to match the answer. Settle the date first by the journal-entries-are-recorded-in-the-writers-journal-directory-one-file-per-entry rule's dating default, and do not put the date to the writer.

## Compressed

1. When creating a journal entry where the writer has not given a **time**, ask them through the selection interface.
2. Do not choose a default time.
3. Do not invent or guess a placeholder time.
4. A date does not settle the time. *Yesterday*, *today*, *last Tuesday*, and an explicit date each fix only the day.
5. The ask fires for each of those date references.
6. The answer decides only whether the entry carries a time and what it is.
7. Settle the date before the ask, by the journal-entries-are-recorded-in-the-writers-journal-directory-one-file-per-entry rule's dating default.
8. Where the writer referred to a day, the entry takes that day. Where they referred to none, it takes today.
9. The ask does not revisit the date. Do not put the date to the writer.
10. This rule governs the time alone.

## The ask carries these options

1. **No time.** The filename drops the `T HH-MM` block and becomes `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md`.
2. Under **No time**, the datetime line drops the `at HH:MM` and reads `Ddd Mon D YYYY`.
3. **Now**, with the current time in the label, as in `Now (2:01 PM)`.
4. Under **Now**, the filename takes the `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM` prefix.
5. Under **Now**, the datetime line reads `Ddd Mon D YYYY at HH:MM`.
6. **Enter the time.** The writer gives the value.
7. A value stated to the second takes the `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS` prefix.
8. Every other entered value stops at the minute.
9. **Explain**, per the foundation package's present-every-prompt-to-the-engineer-through-the-selection-ui rule.

## Applying the answer

1. Offer **Now** only for an entry about today.
2. For a back-dated entry, offer only **No time**, **Enter the time**, and **Explain**.
3. Hold **Now** to the minute. Drop the clock's seconds value from the stamp.
4. Write seconds in a filename only where the writer stated seconds. No answer produces a resolution the writer did not give.
5. **Enter the time** is an answer within the question, not an agent-supplied free-text option. Offering it does not break the present-every-prompt-to-the-engineer-through-the-selection-ui rule.
6. A date-only entry sorts to the start of its day, matching the filename sort where `-` precedes `T`.
7. Name the file and write the datetime line to match the answer.

## History

Until Sun Oct 25 2026 this rule was named ask-for-entry-time-or-omit-it.

Related:

- the journal-entries-are-recorded-in-the-writers-journal-directory-one-file-per-entry rule — the dating default that settles the date, and the filename stamp
- the a-journal-entry-has-a-human-readable-datetime-line-under-its-title rule — the in-content line that drops the time with it
- the foundation package's present-every-prompt-to-the-engineer-through-the-selection-ui rule — the interface, the `Explain` option, and the free-text option this rule's third option is not
