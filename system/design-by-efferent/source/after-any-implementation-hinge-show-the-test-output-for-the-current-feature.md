# After any implementation hinge, show the test output for the current feature

- **Solubility:** 91
- **Original rank:** 105 of 106
- **Unclarity:** 0.06

Every time an implementation hinge is satisfied, **show the test output for the current feature**, without being asked. The hinge is satisfied when the just-accepted implementation is written and the suite is run. Do not show only the single outcome's test. Run and display the **whole feature's** tests, meaning every outcome built so far for the unit under development. The human then sees the feature's accumulated behavior at each implementation step.

Run the feature's tests with verbose output, so the context tree, the `comment` and `detail` narration, and pass/fail are visible. Show that output in the same turn as reporting the implementation.

**Why:** the implementation hinge is where solubility is judged, and solubility is judged against behavior, not code. Showing the *feature's* output, all its outcomes together, keeps the growing efferent contract in view as it accumulates. The human then deliberates the new outcome in the context of the ones already established, rather than in isolation. Surfacing it automatically keeps the loop's load-bearing artifact present without the human asking each turn.

**How to apply:** write an accepted implementation and run the suite. Then run the current feature's test files with verbose output. Include that output in the turn that reports the implementation. The engineer then judges solubility on what is shown. The each-hinge-displays-the-actuation-as-its-anchor-and-the-contexts-once rule shows the implementation and the just-satisfied test. This one requires the **feature's full test output** at **every** implementation hinge.

## Compressed

1. After each implementation hinge, show the whole feature's test output without being asked.
2. First, write the accepted implementation and run the suite.
3. Then run every test file of the current feature.
4. The feature's tests are every outcome built so far for the unit, not only the new one.
5. Run them with verbose output, so the context tree, the `comment` and `detail` narration, and pass or fail show.
6. Put the output in the turn that reports the implementation.
7. The each-hinge-displays-the-actuation-as-its-anchor-and-the-contexts-once rule shows the implementation and the new outcome's test. This rule adds the feature's full output.
