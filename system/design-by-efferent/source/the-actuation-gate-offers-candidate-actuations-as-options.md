# The actuation gate offers candidate actuations as options

**Trigger:** When presenting the actuation hinge of an outcome

At the actuation gate — the first gate, where the cradle is set — the AI does not commit a single actuation and proceed. It presents the human a small set of **candidate actuations** as options to choose among. The human then either:

- **chooses** the option that reads as the more soluble use, or
- takes the **free-text option** — dictating the actuation outright, or opening a chat to work out what it should be.

This is how the highest-leverage hinge is handed over for deliberation, that hinge being the efferent shape of the actuation. The engineer compares concrete alternatives. The free-text option, always there, covers the case where the right shape is not among the options.

The form is deliberate. It is the form every hinge takes, and the the-hinge-cycle-is-actuation-observation-controls-implementation-and-naming rule states it and the two results it rests on: the human produces the answer rather than approving one, and the free-text option is mandatory because the best answer is often one only the human can produce.

## A candidate varies what the use site states

**That is the whole test.** Two actuations are distinct candidates when a reader at the use site sees different words. Where the use site reads the same either way, the two are one candidate, and offering the two of them pads the gate.

**An omitted argument is a candidate.** `upload.(file)` beside `upload.(file, retries: 3)` is a real pair. The first makes the retry policy the object's own and leaves every use site identical. The second makes every use site state the count.

**Whether a value reaches the use site is the efferent decision.** So an absent parameter is a decision about the interface rather than the lack of one. This is the case most easily discarded, because the shorter shape reads as the other one with something missing.

**A chained construction is not an actuation.** `Upload.build(retries: 3).(file)` constructs and actuates in one expression. The actuation in it is `upload.(file)`, with the constructed object bound to an explaining variable on its own line. Construction is the **controls** hinge's concern, so a construction offered here takes a decision out of the hinge that owns it. The chain also leaves an intermediate unbound, against the way every test file is written.

**A varied receiver is not a candidate.** `Upload.(file, retries: 3)` beside `upload.(file, retries: 3)` is one shape reached two ways. Which interface carries the operation is a real question, and this hinge does not ask it.

**Why the test is worth stating.** The rule already refuses a cosmetic variant, and an agent that could tell a cosmetic variant from a real one would not have produced one. A named test gives the agent something to apply: hold the receiver constant, and ask what the use site states. Without it the gate fails in both directions at once. Three shapes are offered where one decision exists, and the omitted-argument shape is discarded as no shape at all.

**Why:** The actuation is the cradle and the highest-leverage hinge (human-in-the-loop rule, step 1: "the AI may propose the actuation… asks rather than averaging"). Concrete alternatives make the deliberation tractable, and they make the human produce the answer. The mandatory free-text option keeps the human above the AI's mean when the right actuation is one the AI couldn't produce. Together they let the AI carry the proposing work without pulling the human's judgment down to the mean.

**How to apply:** At the first gate, generate a few genuinely distinct candidate actuations. They are different efferent shapes rather than cosmetic variants. Present each as it would read at the use site.

**Judge distinctness by what the use site states.** Keep a shape that omits an argument. Drop a chained construction and a varied receiver.

Offer them through the selection UI, which supplies the free-text option. Do not add one of your own. See the present-every-prompt rule.

If the human chooses one, adopt it as the cradle. If the human writes their own instead, take that actuation or enter a dialogue. Settle the actuation before writing the test file. Do not proceed to the test body until the actuation is settled.

**A lone candidate is presented as every hinge presents one**, beside `Explain`, with no candidate manufactured to reach two. See the the-hinge-cycle-is-actuation-observation-controls-implementation-and-naming rule.

## Compressed

1. At the actuation gate, the first gate where the cradle is set, do not commit a single actuation and proceed.
2. Present the human a small set of candidate actuations as options to choose among.
3. The human either chooses the option that reads as the more soluble use, or takes the free-text option.
4. The free-text option lets the human dictate the actuation outright, or open a chat to work out what it should be.
5. The free-text option is mandatory and always present. It covers the case where the right shape is not among the options.
6. This is the form every hinge takes. See the the-hinge-cycle-is-actuation-observation-controls-implementation-and-naming rule for it and the two results it rests on.
7. Present each candidate as it would read at the use site.
8. Offer the candidates through the selection UI, which supplies the free-text option. Do not add a free-text option of your own. See the present-every-prompt rule.
9. A chosen candidate becomes the cradle. Where the human writes their own instead, take that actuation or enter a dialogue.
10. Settle the actuation before writing the test file. Do not proceed to the test body until it is settled.
11. A lone candidate is presented as every hinge presents one, beside `Explain`, with no candidate manufactured to reach two. See the the-hinge-cycle-is-actuation-observation-controls-implementation-and-naming rule.

## A candidate varies what the use site states

1. Make the candidates genuinely distinct efferent shapes, not cosmetic variants. Two actuations are distinct candidates when a reader at the use site sees different words.
2. Where the use site reads the same either way, the two are one candidate. Do not offer both. That pads the gate.
3. An omitted argument is a candidate. `upload.(file)` beside `upload.(file, retries: 3)` is a real pair.
4. The first makes the retry policy the object's own. The second makes every use site state the count.
5. An absent parameter is an interface decision, not the lack of one. Do not discard the shorter shape as the other with something missing.
6. A chained construction is not an actuation. `Upload.build(retries: 3).(file)` constructs and actuates in one expression.
7. The actuation in it is `upload.(file)`, with the constructed object bound to an explaining variable on its own line, leaving no intermediate unbound.
8. Do not offer a construction here. Construction belongs to the controls hinge.
9. A varied receiver is not a candidate. `Upload.(file, retries: 3)` beside `upload.(file, retries: 3)` is one shape reached two ways.
10. This hinge does not ask which interface carries the operation.
11. To apply the test, hold the receiver constant and ask what the use site states.

## History

Until Sun Oct 25 2026 this rule was named actuation-gate-options-or-chat and titled "The actuation gate: offer candidate actuations as options. The human selects one or writes their own".

Until Mon Oct 26 2026 this rule restated the mechanism every hinge follows: the candidates as options, the mandatory free-text option and its reasons, and a lone candidate beside `Explain`. The the-hinge-cycle-is-actuation-observation-controls-implementation-and-naming rule states it, and this rule now cites it, keeping only what is particular to the actuation.
