The engineer typed `/. $ARGUMENTS`. `/.` is an alias of `/recent`, and does exactly what it does.

1. Where the first word is `help`, say that this command takes no `help`, and that `/process help` prints the help of its command domain. Do nothing more.
2. Otherwise, load the rule that governs the act. From the project root, run `slasher/system/foundation/load-rules.sh the-recent-report-says-what-was-recently-done-and-what-is-next`. Where the project has no `slasher/` directory, run `system/foundation/load-rules.sh` with the same rule name. Follow the rule it prints.
