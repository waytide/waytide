# Experiment — Rule reduction

**Tags:** [experiment]

## Question

**Can the rules a session reads be reduced — in their content, in how they are read, and in how they arrive — and sessions still behave the same?**

It realizes the item *Reducing rule files to their essential directives*, `local/items/2026-09-09T20-36-50Z-reducing-rule-files-to-their-essential-directives-OPEN.md`, and its plan.

## Phases

One at a time, in this order, each on its own branch from the experiment's.

1. **flattening** — `experiment/worktree/rule-reduction.flattening`. Can each rule be flattened to its essential content — present directives and their reasons — and sessions behave the same? *Same effect and outcome* is the engineer's test for what is essential.
2. **packaged-script** — `experiment/worktree/rule-reduction.packaged-script`. Does one packaged script that prints every rule in a fixed order shorten the session-start read?
3. **additional-context** — `experiment/worktree/rule-reduction.additional-context`. Can the session-start hook deliver the rules to the agent before its first response, with no read at all?

## Setup

- **Tags:** [experiment]
- **Upstream branch:** `master`
- **Experiment branch:** `experiment/worktree/rule-reduction`
- **Base:** `5979ee0`, from `master` — the commit that records this experiment
- **Working location:** branch and worktree, chosen at the start. The worktree is `/Users/sbellware/projects/waytide/waytide-experiment-worktree-rule-reduction`, and this working tree stays on `master`.
- **Participation:** attended, chosen at the start.
- **The first phased experiment.** The implementation-lifecycle rule gained its account of phases for it, in `241a95b`.

## Forecast

Committed before the work. Each item carries the agent's confidence.

**Phase 1 — flattening**

1. **The compiled read shrinks by 10% to 25%.** The history moved in the derived-rule-files experiment was 0.8%, so most of the saving has to come from restating, not from moving. *Moderate confidence.*
2. **Sessions answer representative requests the same from the flattened read as from today's**, as the derived-rule-files experiment found for footers and history. *Moderate confidence.*
3. **For a few rules, what is essential is the engineer's judgment rather than the agent's**, as passage 45 of the obsolete-rules experiment was. *Moderate confidence.*

**Phase 2 — packaged-script**

4. **The read falls to one to three tool calls, and its median duration falls well below the variance measured so far — under 20 seconds.** *Moderate confidence.*
5. **The printed rules exceed what one tool result carries**, so the harness saves the output to a file and the agent reads it in parts, giving back some of the saving. *Moderate confidence.*

**Phase 3 — additional-context**

6. **Delivering every rule this way is refuted by size alone.** The channel is capped at 10,000 characters and the compiled read is about 547,000. *High confidence.*
7. **A part of the rules fits, and what fits is not enough to stand in for the read.** *Low confidence.*

## What actually happened

### Phase 1 — flattening, started — 2026-10-21

**The phase branch is `experiment/worktree/rule-reduction.flattening`**, created in the worktree from the experiment's branch at `0e84fcd`. The experiment's branch was first brought level with `master`, which had gained the participation-as-batch-size item and nothing touching the rules.

**The record is kept on the experiment's branches from here.** The copy on `master` stays as the experiment's start recorded it, so the two do not diverge into a conflict when the experiment merges.

**The phase goes one rule at a time, on rules the engineer chooses.** The engineer will give the specifications for which rules form the subject set. Each rule in it is flattened and put to the engineer on its own, rather than the set being flattened by agents and reviewed afterward.

### Candidates for the subject set — 2026-10-21

**The engineer asked which rules combine significant volume with a lack of clarity.** All 108 compiled rules were ranked by size and by six measures of how hard a rule is to follow: average sentence length, the share of sentences over 25 words — STE's limit for descriptive text — past-tense and history words, dashes used as asides, citations of other rules, and negations. The median rule is 3,500 characters at 17 words a sentence. The top candidates were then read.

| rule | characters | what makes it hard to follow |
|---|---|---|
| items-convention | 8,935 | It contradicts itself: "No tag is reserved here" and "The tag describes and decides nothing", where `[work-item]` is now a reserved tag that decides a work item's states and `[idea]` is assigned by rule. It carries history in its body. The highest combined score. |
| announce-waytide-at-session-start | 27,994 | Size above all — three times the next rule and eight times the median. Its sentences are short, and much of it is accounts of earlier forms and failures, kept in the body in the derived-rule-files history move because each carries a reason. |
| an-item-takes-a-log-entry | 7,493 | More argument than instruction: its directives are in its first third, and the rest argues why the rule exists. |
| a-project-declares-its-package-set | 6,156 | Long sentences: 49% are over 25 words, the highest of any rule. Its structure is clear. |
| implementation-lifecycle | 13,855 | Size, and long sentences — 30% over 25 words — with the new phases section added. |

**The agent recommended items-convention**, as the clearest case of both, part of whose unclarity came from additions made on 2026-10-21, **and announce-waytide-at-session-start**, where volume dominates and flattening would show its size effect most. The subject set is the engineer's to specify.

**Each candidate carries a `**Solubility:**` attribute**, at the engineer's direction: the inverse of its rank in the table above, so the least soluble is 1. items-convention is 1, announce-waytide-at-session-start 2, an-item-takes-a-log-entry 3, a-project-declares-its-package-set 4, and implementation-lifecycle 5. The line sits under each source rule's title, and the compiler carries it into the compiled rule.
